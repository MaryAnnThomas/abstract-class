# abstract-class
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Another way, it shows only important things to the user and hides the internal details for example sending sms, you just type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

A class that is declared with abstract keyword, is known as abstract class in java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with body).
